		"Content": "This place is oddly placed on the map or at least to get to it but overall, it was decent. I wasn't ever worried about loud neighbors or too much traffic even if it is off the highway. the only place I ever heard the traffic was in the bathroom but the window was open, so... it was quiet other than that. the little ponds and decor had a japanese feel to it. it was very nice, great price, and close to two freeways. Not much around the hotel but if you have a car, you can get around and it's not that far from places (the longest drive I communted was probably 30 minutes). Nice for couples and families, not so great for frat parties. I'd definitely stay here again.",
