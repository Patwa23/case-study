		"Content": "Stayed here on business. Seemed like a decent value for the area but don't expect anything above average, just basic clean accommodations with the usual amenities, including in-room coffee. Not a bad place, considering it's in a highly commercial/industrial area. The complimentary shuttle to the airport runs every 20 minutes, which was very convenient. Down-side: street noise; housekeeping staff ignore \"do not disturb\" sign, knock on the door and barge in mid-afternoon saying \"room check\" whatever that means; my room was no-smoking on a no-smoking floor but still had an odd smell. Fitness room and pool are oddly located. You have to go out into the garage and re-enter the hotel through another door, which is inconvenient.",
